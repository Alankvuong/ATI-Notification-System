# ATI-Notification-System
This project is an announcement system for a Taekwondo school named American Tigers Inc (ATI). Using Twilio as the main technology to send announcements to clients using SMS, this aims to increase communication between the studio and parents to ensure that important notices are properly relayed in a timely manner.
